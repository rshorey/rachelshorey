                    <p>Math for Love is dedicated to transforming how math is taught and learned. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to experience math as the dynamic, beautiful, rigorous art form that it is. We believe that if everyone gets this experience early, we'll have far fewer people fearing and avoiding math, and far more engaged by it and comfortable with using math as it naturally arises in their lives.</p>

                    <p>From a practical viewpoint, this means we're constantly searching for the most powerful way to share transformative math experiences, and make it simple for teachers to do the same. Currently, most of our time is devoted to professional development for teachers, curriculum development&#8211we just finished writing a summer school curriculum for Seattle Public Schools&#8211and game development. Our first game, Prime Climb, has been extremely popular since its debut in a year and a half ago, and we have high hopes for our new game for younger kids, Tiny Polka Dot. </p>

                    We've always had a deep belief that mathematical thinking is best explored through play, and we've been making math games since we started Math for Love in 2010. The problem is that a lot of so-called math games are actually the opposite: it's a "game" with some math grafted on, where before you can take your next turn, say, you have to solve a math problem. I hate these kinds of games, because the math actually gets in the way of the fun. That's the wrong lesson. We wanted to make a game where arithmetic was the engine. That desire combined at some point with the observation that a smart choice of prime coloration could make the multiplication and division in the game easy for kids who hadn't mastered their facts yet. Prime Climb was the result, though it took 13 more months to get it perfectly right!</p>

                    <p>I never use a calculator when I play, personally. We include a color-coded multiplication table with the game to help with play. It's really a game of weighing the relative value of lots of small decisions. Each individual calculation is relatively straightforward, but it can still be tricky to see your best move.</p>

                    <p>We keep waiting for some engineering grad students (or somebody) to make Prime Climb a drinking game. So far, no one has reached out to us. That said, drink away.</p>

                    <p>Tiny Polka Dot! This is a game for 3 to 8 year-olds. We're really excited about it, because it's effectively a suite of games that allows you do introduce, practice, and conceptually understand virtually all the numeracy you need for Kindergarten and first grade. I think it has the potential to become an indispensable tool in homes, preschools, and Kindergartens.</p>
                    <p>As of my writing this, there are 6 days left in our Kickstarter campaign, and I think we're going to fund within the next 24-48 hours. So it's going to happen!</p>
